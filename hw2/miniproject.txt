My project I want to work on is an interactive story with different choices the user can make to change the outcome of the story. 
This game will keep track of the user's level, items, and skills that they can learn along the way.
The story will have at least 4 choices for each 'fork' in the 'road' and each choice will have a unique outcome.
There will be a simple GUI with a textbox for entering inputs and the user can save their progress if they choose

Some tests that this project will include are:
-user input recognition check
-statistics carry over and update with choices
-test that the interface works fine
-make sure all the choices lead to the correct intended outcomes
-make sure progress can be saved to return later on
